[   +2 ms] Because l10n.yaml exists, the options defined there will be used instead.
           To use the command line arguments, delete the l10n.yaml file in the Flutter project.

[  +16 ms] Arb file for a fallback, es, does not exist, even though 
           the following locale(s) exist: [es_MX]. 
           When locales specify a script code or country code, a 
           base locale (without the script code or country code) should 
           exist as the fallback. Please create a {fileName}_es.arb 
           file.
